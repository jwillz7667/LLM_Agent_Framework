# LLM Agent Framework

## Overview

The LLM Agent Framework is a robust, scalable, and production-ready framework designed to integrate with OpenAI's GPT-4o model. The framework provides various software development automation tools, such as code generation, debugging, code review, testing, and project management, all leveraging the power of large language models (LLMs).

## Features

- **Code Generation**: Automatically generate code based on natural language prompts.
- **Debugging**: Analyze and debug code snippets using AI-powered insights.
- **Code Review**: Perform detailed code reviews to identify potential issues and suggest improvements.
- **Testing**: Generate unit tests for existing code to improve test coverage.
- **Project Management**: Get project management guidance for various software development tasks.
- **Extensible Design**: Easily extend or modify the framework to support additional tasks or AI models.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.10 or later**
- **Pip (Python package installer)**
- **Virtual Environment (recommended)**
- **Docker (optional, for containerized deployment)**
- **Git (for version control)**

### Step-by-Step Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/llm-agent-framework.git
   cd llm-agent-framework
   ```

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment**

   Create and activate a virtual environment to manage dependencies:

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**

   Install the required Python packages from the `requirements.txt` file:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set Up Environment Variables**

   Create a `.env` file in the project root with your OpenAI API key:

   ```bash
   echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key" > .env
   ```

   Replace `your_openai_api_key` with your actual API key from OpenAI.

### Running the Application

To run the Flask application locally:

```bash
python interface/flask_app.py
```

The application will start on `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`. Open this URL in your browser to access the interface.

### Docker Deployment

If you prefer to run the application in a Docker container:

1. **Build the Docker Image**

   ```bash
   docker build -t llm-agent-framework .
   ```

2. **Run the Docker Container**

   ```bash
   docker run -d -p 5000:5000 --env-file .env llm-agent-framework
   ```

   The application will be accessible on `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

## Usage

### Submitting Tasks

1. **Select Task Type**: Choose the type of task (e.g., code generation, debugging, code review, testing, or project management) from the dropdown menu.
2. **Enter Input Data**: Provide the necessary input, such as code snippets or project descriptions.
3. **Submit the Task**: Click "Submit" to send the task to the backend. The result will be displayed in the "Result" section.

### Monitoring
